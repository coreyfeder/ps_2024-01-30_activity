    <h1>Familiar: Ferret</h1>
    <h2 style="display:none;">Flavor</h2>
    <p>
        Known for being fun-loving, energetic, and curious, ferrest also sport keen senses, a thick hide, and formidable jaws. Their powerful bodies are made for digging and hunting in burrows, but they are equally capable climbers and swimmers; they excel at infiltration and exfiltration. Combining these with their startling intelligence, ingenious problem-solving, and pack coordination, they have the makings of truly wondrous creatures. Their fleeting concentration, obssessive-compulsive behaviors, and sleping habits could be all that stands between them and devastation. While their reputation paints them as mischief spirits in fur coats, they more closely resemble tiny dragons with ADD.

        Having a ferret as a familiar is an excellent opportunity to inject shenanigans and chaos into a campaign. Both player and DM should be prepared to cause some mustelid mayhem.
